# Little Lemon

## What is it?

## Just created a really basic app with basic functionality for a fake restaurant.

## TL:DR

- Basically using react hook form for form control
- Using Jest/react testing library for tests
- Using react router 6 for the routes

## What changed?

This was a project from the meta front end developer course but the whole thing was planned on legacy code. The API we were supposed to be using didn't work so I had to improvise and just alert the booking to the screen.
I'm not entirely sure that reviewers would be happy jumping through a bunch of hoops to install much else but it is pretty easy to turn this into a MERN project and get full operability. I was thinking to make a 2D array and just offer a 1 week option. This would just refresh when the user reloaded the app though.

## Future work

There's a bunch of stuff I could do to make it better. There wasn't a lot of time making it look pretty so I could do that using more bootstrap for quickness if needed.
